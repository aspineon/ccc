# Crap Code Challenge

Because my channel on Youtube colleced more than 100 subs I desided to start small challenge. I found my 5-years-old project in ASP.NET MVC 4 with a lot of CRAP CODE. And I want to do refactoring process from crap to shiny code with as much good practices as is possible.

## Where I can find videos with process of refactoring?

On my Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/Zajacmarekblog

On videos I'm speaking Polish. But you can watch my code anyway :)

## Any rules?

I must modifying existing code, no rewrite whole application from scratch. And I start with database so any change must work with old data and old code in different parts of application.

Any commit contains process of changes. So if you want to see worst code on the Earth you can see first commit "Init" :)

I work on branches and pull requests. So I can also train my Git skills.
